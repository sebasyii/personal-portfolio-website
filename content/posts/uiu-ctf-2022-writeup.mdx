I took part in UIUCTF 2021 which was an annual Capture the Flag Competition run by undergraduate students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

It gave me tremendous experience as I am relatively new in the Cyber field. My team, Social Engineering Experts, ended 18th place, out of 658 scoring teams.

I solved mostly OSINT and Forensics Challenges.

Overall, it was an amazing CTF and I have learnt a ton.

## Solution

We are provided with a backup of the tablet <code>tablet.tar.gz</code>.

### Overview of the files provided

In order to make things easier, I've decided to use the tool iLEAPP to give me a better overview of the system.

> iLEAPP is an iOS Logs, Events, And Plists Parser.
> It currently supports iOS/iPadOS 11, 12, 13 and 14.
> It can parse directly from a compressed .tar/.zip file, a decompressed directory, or an iTunes/Finder backup folder.
> More Details can be found here.

After running with iLEAPP, I am presented with an overview of the current snapshot of the tablet system.

While browsing the file system, the challenge description gave me some ideas on where to start.

<em>
  "It looks like Red has been exfiltrating sensitive data bound for Mira HQ to
  their own private server. We need to access that server and contain the leak."
</em>

This gave me some inspiration. They could be using some apps to communicate with an external server so I decided to start from the mobile installation logs to see what the user has installed on the system.

Bingo! The user has installed webssh which is a communication app that allows the user to connect to a server through ssh.

## OSINT The Creator

This is fairly easy.

I went to click on the admin's profiles and I managed to find it.

## OSINT The Creator 2

> I released another flag somewhere on one of my Twitter accounts. Can you find it?!
> Author: Thomas

The challenge provided the author's twitter account.

On the author's twitter, he also provided a personal account. @Thomas_Quig

As I do not want to waste time, I used a tool provided on github, called twint.

I ran the scrapper and I got the answer.

`twint -u Thomas_Quig -s uiuctf{`
