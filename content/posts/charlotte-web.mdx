<Box py={6} px={7} rounded="lg" color="white">
  This project was developed in 4 months in conjunction with the Tech 4 Good
  Hackathon 2021. The competition was to develop a solution to one of their 26
  problem statements, ranging from improving telescopes for the blind,
  communication tools for the aphasic, and everything in between!

  Why did you choose this problem?

<Text my={4} as="span">
  The reason why we chose this problem statement was because while we were
  exploring the problem statements, we found that this problem statement is the
  one that we were able to make the most impact on. Also through discovery, we
  found that there wasn't any chrome extension that allow us to create a custom
  accessibility tool.
